#   Host-Client List File     #
###############################

#
# This file will take effect only when in bluenode.conf the following were
# defined:
#
# when a BlueNode runs a Local Network
# Network = false
#
# when a BlueNode has requested to use a user.list
# UseClientList = true
#

#
# In this file you may define a list of allowed host-clients
# to be authenticated by the Blue Node
#
# Use like:
# Username Password Hostname Virtual_Address_Number
#
# for the Virtual_Address_Number field use an integer starting from number 1, # the BlueNode will auto convert the number to its respective IP address
# you may repeat the same Username and Password with a different Hostname
# and Virtual_Address in case the same user owns more than one devices
#
# ex.
# bob 12345 bob-laptop 2
# bob 12345 bob-mobile 3
